          <p>Understanding an individual's life history strategy and the reproductive efforts lends to a greater insight of the trade-offs one has faced throughout their lives. Interpreting your own life history can give you more insight into your own preferences, as well.</p>

        <h2>What is life history?</h2>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>At the macro level, life history acts on a species level, generally describing the changes an organism undergoes throughout its lifespan. Humans, for example, possess a biologically unique life history, in that we experience an extended period of dependency in youth, endure relatively long lives, undergo puberty and menopause later in life, and typically look to paternal resource gathering during childhood. Life history theory studies how key events in an someones's life relate to reproductivity and mortality. Most people go through specific stages of the reproductive cycle around specific ages, but variation exists in the intra- and inter-cultural levels, and also within individuals.
          <br>
          <br>
          Every individual's life history is influenced by a series of factors that shape their pursuit of ideal lifestyles. Some aspects include:

        <h2>Trade-offs</h2>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>We as humans are limited by time. Day-by-day, month-by-month, year-by-year. There is only so much time to live a fulfilling life and to be able achieve all of your lifeâ€™s goals. One of the most important aspects of life-history theory is the idea that humanity faces constant trade-offs between growth, maintenance, and reproduction. <b>Growth</b> pertains to self-investment for the future, whether through education, career-pursuits, or other edifications. <b>Maintenance</b> refers to short-term, self-investment in the pursuit of health and wellness. <b>Reproduction</b> refers to the long-term investment in mating, family, and child rearing.
        <br>
        <br>
        Approaching these trade-offs and weighing the benefits of every option is an individual effort. Trade-offs vary between genders, between individuals, and within individuals, thus everybody experiences different options. In your journey toward becoming a parent, it is important to understand what you are giving up in pursuit of reproduction. Have you focused enough on growth to be able to amply provide for a child passionately, educationally, and financially? Are you doing your health a great disservice through enduring a full-term pregnancy and childbirth?
        <br><br>
        In fairness, it may be difficult to tell. Or, a steady environment now may crumble in the upcoming months. Life is a dynamic process; even if you must make sacrifices in one facet of your life to achieve wellbeing in another, understand that this process occurs within every human being on a daily basis.
