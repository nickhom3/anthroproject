        <br>
        <p><b>Attachment theory</b> suggests that the most important factor in the emotional and social development of a child is a secure attachment to one or more caretakers. This is a facet of life that exists not only within the human race, but within the greater primate order. As human life history has created an extended juvenile period where young humans cannot provide ample care for themselves, parents usually act as their primary caretakers until they reach adulthood. This care centers around physical and emotional presence, as there are long-term negative side effects to neglect:</p>
          <br>
          <ul>
            <li>Impulse control issues</li>
            <li>Social withdrawal</li>
            <li>Difficulty regulating emotions</li>
            <li>Tantrums</li>
            <li>Self-harm</li>
            <li>Low academic achievement</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
      <p>
        The <b>naturalistic fallacy</b> may suggest, however, that parents, or specifically mothers, should be the sole providers of their children. Dr. William Sears' ideas of the "7 Baby B's" exemplifies an extremist view of this fallacy. He argues that the following practices are the best methods for all mothers:
      </p>
      <br>
      <ol>
        <li>Birth Bonding</li>
        <li>Breastfeeding</li>
        <li>Babywearing</li>
        <li>Bedsharing</li>
        <li>Belief in baby's cries</li>
        <li>Balance and boundaries</li>
        <li>Beware of baby trainers</li>
      </ol>
      <br>
      <p>
        Ironically, by listening to our words, you are breaking his seventh tenet.
        <br>
        <br>
        While the mother-infant bond may seem to be a simple and natural process, the relationship is much more complex. <b>Postpartum depression</b> is often a result of the conflict between the needs of a child and the resources available to a mother. The natural fallacy further exacerbates this by promoting the idea that mothers should only look within themselves and the child's father for resources. However, more and more research has begun to emerge about the benefits of a secure attachment of a child to a network of caretakers that extends beyond the mother.

          Throughout the world, maternal investment remains an important factor in the upbringing of a child. Yet, many other people play a part in <b>cooperative breeding</b>. Breastfeeding is one reason as to why mothers need to maintain some connection to their children, as lactation is only triggered through pregnancy. Especially in more industrialized societies where mothers often host other tasks like housework or providing a stable income, it's important that mothers are aware that searching for alternative sources of care is a common practice and a characteristic of human society. <br><br>The following table represents data compiled in a 2010 article by Karen Kramer. Each percentage represents the mean proportion of direct child care received by a child. We can infer that while mothers remain the main caregivers, they only represent ~50% of total effort.

          Given that there is flexibility in who/how many people should care for a child, there still exists a need for a secure relationship with a caregiver. In 1969, Mary Ainesworth developed the <b>Strange Situation Test</b> to measure the attachment characteristics between a caregiver and child. Early attachment has a significant impact on an individual's ability to form relationships later in life, as the child-caregiver relationship often acts as the first and the strongest relationship an individual may form.
          <br>
          <br>
          In her experiment, a mother and child are left in a room with toys with which the child becomes acclimated to its situation. A stranger then enters and attempts to interact with the mother and child individually, giving the mother an opportunity to exit the room. After a brief period, the mother then re-enters the room. Ainesworth developed three<b> attachment styles</b> based on the reactions of children studied through her experiment:

            <h3>Secure</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
              In her experiment, children who exibit a secure attachment to their caregiver <b>freely explore</b> when the caregiver is present, <b>interact</b> with strangers, expresses <b>sadness</b> when caregiver leaves, and expresses <b>happiness</b> when the caregiver returns.
              <br><br>
              This models the optimal interaction between caregiver and child. A secure attachment style indicates the caregiver offers <b>consistent</b> attention to the needs and emotional wellbeing of the child. In the long-term, this attachment style breeds the greater ability to build confident and trusting relationships with others.

              In her experiment, children who exibit an anxious-avoidant attachment to their caregiver <b>explore little</b> when the caregiver is present, is <b>wary</b> around strangers, expresses <b>distress</b> when caregiver leaves, and expresses <b>ambivalence</b> when the caregiver returns.
              
              <br><br>
              An an attachment style indicates the caregiver offers <b>inconsistent</b> attention to the needs and emotional wellbeing of the child. The child is then stressed in new or unexpected circumstances when the actions of a caregiver have historically varied. In the long-term, this attachment style often breeds relationships characterized by over-dependence and the necessity of commitment.

              <br><br>
              An anxious-avoidant attachment style indicates the caregiver not only offers <b>very inconsistent</b> attention to the needs and emotional wellbeing of the child, but also consistently ignores communication by the child. Thus, the child believes that communication is an ineffective way of expressing emotion. In the long-term, this attachment style frequently creates individuals who avoid intimacy, possess low self-confidence, and seek low-risk relationships.

            In modern times, the economic role has grown tremendously from one often cemented in household duties and childcare. Women today have greater access to education, high-paying careers, and benefits. Thus, most modern women face more <b>competition for their time</b>. Stuck between work, education, and/or childcare, the amount of physical energy available to women in many societies is spread thin. In fact, while women can start releasing eggs as young as 8 years old until, possibly, into their 60s, the average American woman does not have their first child until <b>26.3 years old</b>. Therefore, in starting multi-child families, females must act on short interbirth intervals with long periods of dependency with each child. While the type and quantity of assistance varies by source, <b>humans rely on cooperative breeding</b> for reproductive success.
            <br>
            <br>
            While a <b>doula's</b> or <b>midwife's</b> duties may extend from the antepartum to the postpartum phase of a mother's birth process, they do not provide permanent solutions to a mother who has a greater responsibility to her family than childcare.

            <b>Daycares</b> and <b>nannies</b> are the modern solution to this problem. The former not only provides a child with a group of dedicated caregivers to attend to their needs, but it also provides a social setting through which young children can learn to interact with others and develop interpersonal skills.
            <br>
            <br>
            However, despite the network of potential caregivers available to mothers, researchers still <b>emphasize the mother-child bond</b>. Thus, mothers should still aim to create a secure relationship through <b>consistent</b> attention that is <b>sensitive</b> to the emotions and needs of their children.
