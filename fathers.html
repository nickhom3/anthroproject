          <br>
          <p>Why should you care as a father? What benefits do you gain toward nurturing a child? Fatherhood varies across cultures, thus the paternal role varies throughout the world. Here's why no matter how you "Dad," you are doing something right.</p>

        <h2>A balancing act</h2>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
        Just as mothers, fathers face the same issues in allocating time for work, social relationships, and their families. One of the unique components of human life history is the majority reliance on males for the gathering of nutrients for the family unit. In fact, natural selection favors male involvement through increased child wellbeing, even if the male is not physically present as much as the mother. Even so, <b>half of American children live</b> in a household without their father at some point in their lives. So why is male involvement in parenting as much of an issue that you are reading this webpage? One would think that males would want to tend to their offspring and nurture them to adulthood, and those people would not be wrong. However, men do care that they are, in fact, caring for their own child.

          The issue is that mothers require external support to assist in managing their own energy resources and to raise their children. Cooperative breeding plays a common role throughout cultures, where non-parents assist in childcare while parents tend to resource gathering or maintenance. In most places around the world, fathers have transitioned to roles dedicated to providing materials for the family, rather than assisting in direct childcare.
